# Features
- Common symbols and punctuation accessible through combos with many duplicated on both sides; combos trigger through most layers.
- Repeat key on right thumb, magic key on left thumb.
- Home block mods on main layer (toggle-able).
- Control key overrides for easier left-hand only use; overrides disabled on home block mods.
- Symbol layer optimised for (La)TeX editing, with brackets and many common strings as inward rolls, e.g.; `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `^{}`, `_{}`, `!()`, `<-`, `<=`, `->`, `>=`, `|->`, `:-`, `&=`, etc. (Intended to be used with snippet extensions.) Backslash also on main thumb key on this layer.
- Brackets duplicated on Edit layer for easier access.
- Program layer optimised for c programming, with comparison operators as inward rolls, logical/bitwise operators symbols closely grouped on index finger, etc.
- Number grid on right hand with [1,2,3] on home row.
- Function layer on right hand, F1-F5 duplicated on left side for left-hand only usage.
- Mouse emulation accessible on pinky keys; movement same position as arrow keys on navigation layer, scrolling underneath in vim layout.
