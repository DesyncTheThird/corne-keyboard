# Features
- Common symbols and punctuation accessible through combos with many duplicated on both sides; combos trigger through most layers. (See my [Sofle keymap](https://github.com/DesyncTheThird/sofle-keymap) for combos; image for Corne WIP.)
- Alpha-only repeat key with layer-tap on right thumb key.
- Home block mods on main layer (toggle-able).
- Symbol layer optimised for (La)TeX editing, with brackets and many common strings as inward rolls, e.g.; `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `^{}`, `_{}`, `!()`, `<-`, `<=`, `->`, `>=`, `|->`, `:-`, `&=`, etc. Backslash also on main thumb key on this layer.
- Brackets duplicated on Edit layer for easier access.
- Program layer optimised for c programming, with comparison operators as inward rolls, logical/bitwise operators symbols closely grouped on index finger, etc.
- Number grid on right hand with [1,2,3] on home row.
- Function layer on right hand, F1-F5 duplicated on left side for left-hand only usage.
- Mouse emulation accessible on pinky keys; movement same position as arrow keys on navigation layer, scrolling underneath in vim layout.
- Steno layer (using GeminiPR) accessible through combo.

## OLEDs
### Right:
- Default layer and layer stack display;
- Clock -- time is set manually using keys on utility layer and doesn't require software on host (persists through sleep events);
- Custom locking key state, modifier state, and mute state indicators.

### Left:
- Cycles between text and logo with cyberpunk glich aesthetic animation;
- Logo displays WPM and current session time.

Key on utility layer available to change both OLEDs to static images.
