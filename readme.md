# Features
- Common symbols and punctuation accessible through combos with many duplicated on both sides; combos trigger through most layers. (See my [Sofle keymap](https://github.com/DesyncTheThird/sofle-keymap) for combos; image for Corne WIP.)
- Home block mods on main layer (toggle-able).
- Symbol layer optimised for (La)TeX editing, with brackets and many common strings as inward rolls, e.g.; `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `^{}`, `_{}`, `<-`, `<=`, `->`, `>=`, `|->`, `:-`, `&=`, etc. Backslash also on main thumb key on this layer.
- Number grid accessible on both hands; function keys 1-5 on left hand; all function keys on right hand.
- Mouse emulation accessible on pinky keys; movement same position as arrow keys on navigation layer, scrolling underneath in vim layout.
- Steno layer (using geminipr) accessible through combo.

## OLEDs
